Mixed Integer Linear Programming Model to Solve LinkedIn Queens Game
# LinkedIn Queens Game Solver

## Overview

The LinkedIn Queens Game is a version of the classic chess problem where the goal is to place queens on a chessboard without them threatening each other. This project uses Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) to find solutions for the game.

## Features

- Solve the queens placement problem using MILP.
- Easy to customize for different board sizes.
- Visual representation of the solution.
- Solved by using CPLEX Python API, supplementary libraries are matplotlib.pyplot, scipy.sparse, random and numpy
